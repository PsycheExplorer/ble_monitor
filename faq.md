## Why is this component called passive and what does this mean

Unlike the original `mitemp_bt` component (and most other solutions), this custom component does not use connections (polling) to collect data. The fact is that many sensors from the Xiaomi ecosystem transmit information themselves about their condition to the air with some frequency. We need only to "passively" receive these messages and update the status of the corresponding entities in the Home Assistant. What does this give us?

- firstly, it reduces the power consumption of the sensors (the battery lasts longer), since the sensor does not transmit anything other than that provided by its developers.
- secondly, since the range of bluetooth is rather limited, passive reception can solve some problems that arise when using "polling" components. In the case of connecting to a sensor, a two-way exchange takes place, which means we not only should “hear” the sensor well, but the sensor, in its turn, must also “hear” us well, and this could be problematic. To increase the radius of reception, you can, for example, install an external bt-dongle with a large antenna on your host, to make it "hear" better, but you can’t do anything with the sensor itself. A passive data collection method solves this problem, because in this case the sensor does not know about our existence, and should not "hear" us at all. The main thing is that we "hear" it well.
- another important point is the fact that the frequency of sending data for many sensors is quite high. For example, the LYWSDCGQ sensor sends about 20-25 measurements per minute. If your sensor is far away, or you have poor reception conditions, you only need to receive one out of twenty messages to update your Home Assistant entity... Not a bad chance, is it? And if you increase the `period` option, then the chances increase even more. In addition, receiving a stream of 20-25 measurements per minute gives you the opportunity to increase the resolution of measurements by averaging (which is implemented in our component) and this gives more smooth (beautiful, if you want) graphs and a faster reaction of corresponding automations.
- passive method allows without problems collecting data from several interfaces simultaneously, which expands your ability to increase the reception area. For example, you can use several external BT-dongles connected by cheap [USB-RJ45 extenders](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1q0VKodcnBKNjSZR0q6AFqFXae.jpg) and high-quality cat5/6 ethernet cables.

I’m not sure that I have listed all the advantages resulting from the passivity of this component. But I hope that I was able to explain the essence.

## INSTALLATION ISSUES

### I get a PermissionError in Home Assistant after the installation or python upgrade

Python needs root access to access the HCI interface. If Python doesn't have root access, you will get an error message in Home Assistant which ends with:

```shell
PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

First, try to set root access with

```shell
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `readlink -f \`which python3\``
```

Next, check that it is set correctly with the following command

```shell
sudo getcap `readlink -f \`which python3\``
```

The command will return the path to python and looks like (can vary based on your python version):

```shell
/usr/bin/python3.7 = cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip
```

Make sure you first stop Home Assistant and then start Home Assistant again. Restarting Home Assistant is not enough, as the python process does not exit upon restart.

If you have multiple python versions, make sure it refers to the same version which is used by Home Assistant. If Home Assistant is using a different version, e.g. python3.6, run the following command to set the correct version (adjust it to your own version if needed).

```shell
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' /usr/bin/python3.6
```

### How do I find the number of the HCI interface?

To find the correct number, run the following command:

```shell
hcitool dev
```

The command will return the HCI interface number and mac address.

```shell
Devices:
        hci0    B8:27:EB:77:75:50
```

### I get AttributeError: module 'socket' has no attribute 'AF_BLUETOOTH' in Home Assistant after the installation or python upgrade

This means that Python is built/installed without support for Bluetooth. You will have to rebuild Python 3 with `bluetooth.h`. When using a virtual environment (venv), you can do this with the following instructions. Please make a backup first!!!, as you will have to delete the venv with Home Assistant and reinstall it in a new venv. You might need to modify commands for your own situation. 

1. Install BT library with:

``` 
sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth-dev
sudo pip3 install pybluez
```

2. Rebuild Python:

```
cd Python-3.8.6/
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

3. Disable systemctl and reboot:

```
sudo systemctl disable home-assistant@homeassistant
sudo reboot
```

4. Removed old venv and save Home Assistant configuration:

```
cd /srv/homeassistant
sudo rm * -R
cd ..
sudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant homeassistant
cd /home/homeassistant
sudo mv .homeassistant/ .homeassistant_backup
sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
```

5. Create a new venv and install HomeAssistant again:

```
cd /srv/homeassistant
python3.8 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip3 install homeassistant
hass -v
```

6. When you see `INFO (MainThread) [homeassistant.core] Starting Home Assistant` in log use CTRL+C to break and restore your Home Assistant configuration:

```
deactivate 
exit
cd /home/homeassistant
sudo rm .homeassistant/ -R
sudo mv .homeassistant_backup/ .homeassistant
sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/homeassistant/
sudo systemctl enable home-assistant@homeassistant
sudo reboot
```

7. Wait a long time before all plugins are installed in Home Assistant


### How can I create a battery sensor?

You can set option `batt_entities` to `True` - the battery sensor entity will be created automatically for each device reporting battery status.

Or you can create a battery sensor by using a template sensor. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`. Make sure you adjust the name of the sensor with your own sensor.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      ble_battery_582d34339449:
        friendly_name: "Battery"
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        value_template: "{{ state_attr('sensor.ble_temperature_582d34339449', 'battery_level') }}"
        device_class: "battery"
```

## RECEPTION ISSUES

### My sensor doesn't receive any readings from my sensors anymore or only occasionally

The custom component uses Bluetooth (BLE) to receive messages from your sensor(s). The number of messages per minute that are being send by your sensor depends on the type, but is around 20 messages per minute for LYWSDCGQ, LYWSD02 and CGG1 sensors, around 2 per minute for HHCCPOT002 and around 1 per minute for HHCCJCY01T.

The number of messages that are received by Home Assistant can be less or even zero. Parameters that affect the reception of messages are:

- The distance between the sensor and the Bluetooth device on your Home Assistant device.

Try to keep the distance as limited as possible.

- Interference with other electrical devices.

Especially SSD devices are known to affect the Bluetooth reception, try to place your SSD drive as far as possible from your Bluetooth tranceiver.

- Metal cases are a big problem for built-in bluetooth and wifi without an external antenna!

- The quality of your Bluetooth transceiver.

The range of the built-in Bluetooth tranceiver of a Raspberry Pi is known to be limited. Try using an external Bluetooth transceiver to increase the range, e.g. with an external antenna.
It is also worth noting that starting from v0.5.5, a component can receive data from multiple interfaces simultaneously (see the `hci_interface` option).

- You should also pay attention to [this issue](#my-sensor-stops-receiving-updates-some-time-after-the-system-restart), since your problem may not be directly related to reception.

### How to increase coverage

There are several ways to increase coverage:

- use an external BT-dongle (preferably with a full-size antenna).
- use multiple spaced BT-dongles. You can experiment with various extension cords (for example, inexpensive [USB-RJ45 extenders](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1q0VKodcnBKNjSZR0q6AFqFXae.jpg) in combination with a regular ethernet cable).
- use additional devices with their own BT-interface, and connect them to Home Assistant. For example, it could be another raspberrypi with Home Assistant and our component, connected to the main host using the [remote_homeassistant](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote) component, which links multiple Home Assistant instances together.

### My sensor's BLE advertisements are encrypted, how can I get the key?

The BLE messages from some sensors are encrypted. To decrypt these messages, you need to configure the encryption key. The encryption key (also called bind key) is only visible at the moment it is created, e.g. when adding the sensor to the MiHome app. There are several ways to get the encryption key:

1. TelinkFlasher (LYWSD03MMC sensors only)

    Get the encryption key with the online tool on the [TelinkFlasher website](https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html).

    ![Telink Flasher](/pictures/Telink_flasher_website.png)

    - Keep the sensor close to the mobile phone (android only) or Windows computer.
    - Make sure that the bluetooth is enabled.
    - Using your browser, navigate to [this page](https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html).
    - Now, click the [Connect] button (1) and wait until it shows "Connected." See the Log section at the bottom.
    - Once connected, click the [Do Activation] button (2) and wait until the "Mi Bind Key" (3) shows the information.

    Note that this last step will generate a new encryption key, which means it won't be connected to the MiHome app anymore. If you want to use MiHome and our custom component at the same time, you wil have to use one of the other options.
    
  
2. MiHome mod (Android only) 

    Get the key with the customized [MiHome mod](https://www.kapiba.ru/2017/11/mi-home.html) with the following steps.

    - You will first have to allow apps to be installed from “unknown sources” in your android settings (Settings – security – select “unknow sources).
    - Create a folder `/devicestorage/vevs/logs`, where `devicestorage` is the internal storage of your phone. It's important to do this before installing the app. 
- [Download](https://www.kapiba.ru/2017/11/mi-home.html) MiHome mod and install the MiHome mod apk on your android phone. Use google translate to translate the website, as the website is only available in Russian. At the bottom, you will find the download link to the latest version. MiHome mod is basically just MiHome with some translatons from chinese to English and Russian, but also with the possibility to save the encryption key.
    - During setup of the app, give access to the local device storage.
    - Add the sensor device to the MiHome app.
    - After setting up, a file `pairings.txt` will be created in `/devicestorage/vevs/logs/misc/pairings.txt`. Open this file. The encryption key you need is called `Bindkey`. Also make a note of the corresponding Mac. If the `pairings.txt` file isn't created, try an older version of MiHome mod. 


3. Intercepting the MiHome application traffic

    Get the key from the MiHome application traffic (in violation of the Xiaomi user agreement terms). 

    Unfortunately, Xiaomi has enabled additional encryption of API requests recently, and therefore the procedure for intercepting traffic has become much more complicated. Most of the instructions below won't work anymore, as they are written at the time before encryption was enabled, but we are currently (successfully) looking into the [Charles proxy method](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/198#issuecomment-748638122) to deal with this encryption. If you are successfull with this or one of the other methods, please open an issue and share the steps you took with us. 

      - iOS:
        - [using Charles proxy, paid $7-10](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/7#issuecomment-595327131). For more detailed instructions, check [these instructions](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/198#issuecomment-748638122).

      - Android:
        - using Packet Capture.
        - [using Burp Suite](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/7#issuecomment-599780750), device must be rooted.

## OTHER ISSUES

### Conflicts with other components using the same BT interface

Since our component uses a special operating mode of the HCI interface and works with a continuous data stream, conflicts with other software using the same HCI interface are possible. The conflict is caused by the fact that another component can switch the HCI interface to a different operating mode, thereby stopping the reception of data. Or our component may lead to malfunctioning of another component.
A reliable, but not the only way out of this situation (apart from the refusal to use one component in favor of another) can be the use of two BT-interfaces (one for our component, the second, for example, for the tracker). Work is underway to find other solutions to such situations...

### My sensor stops receiving updates some time after the system restart

Often, the cause of this is the presence of bugs in the system components responsible for the BT operation (kernel modules, firmwares, etc). As a rule, in such cases, the corresponding entries appear in the system log. Please carefully review the contents of your `syslog`, and try searching the Internet for a solution - with high probability you are not alone in this. For example, here is an issue with a typical Raspberry PI problem - [BT problem, Raspberry PI3 and Hass.io](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/31#issuecomment-595417222)

In addition, in the case of Raspberry Pi, a common problem is a lack of power. If you do not observe any negative effects associated with a lack of power, then this does not mean that they actually are not present. We have feedback from users who have solved their bluetooth problems installing a more powerful power supply and high-quality cable. Good powering is very important for raspberry. In addition to a sufficiently powerful power supply, attention should be paid to the power cable - it should be able to deliver this power. Often, to compensate for losses, power supplies are made with a slightly higher output voltage (up to 5.1V or even 5.25V).

### My sensor from the Xiaomi ecosystem is not in the list of supported ones. How to request implementation?

- [Install the component](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install) if you have not already done so.
- Make sure you have [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) enabled, and logging enabled for `info` level (globally or just for `custom_components.ble_monitor`). For example:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warn
  logs:
    custom_components.ble_monitor: info
```

- Place your sensor extremely close to the HA host (BT interface).
- [Enable the option](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/blob/master/README.md#configuration) `report_unknown`.
- Wait until a number of "BLE ADV from UNKNOWN" messages accumulate in the log.
- Create a new [issue](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues), write everything you know about your sensor and attach the obtained log.
- Do not forget to disable the `report_unknown` option (delete it or set it to `False` and restart HA)! Since the potentially large output of this option will spam the log and can mask really important messages.
- Wait for a response from the developers.

### My sensor isn't showing the battery level

Battery level is not broadcasted by all sensors. Check the list of [supported sensors](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/blob/master/README.md#supported-sensors) to see if your sensor supports battery level. LYWSD02 sensors need to be updated to firmware 1.1.2_00085 or above to the show battery level.

## TIPS AND TRICKS

### How to know exactly if the reception of data from my sensors has stopped?

When the reception of data from sensors is stopped for some reason (hardware failure, errors at the system level, and so on), it may take an unacceptably long time before we notice this fact.
[Here is](https://github.com/custom-components/ble_monitor/issues/65#issuecomment-615911228) a discussion of a solution to solve this problem using a template binary sensor, which can be used in automation to send notifications, for example.

### How can I add a sensor in lovelace that shows the RSSI signal strength?

There are several ways to do this. If you want to show it in an entity card, you can add it in lovelace directly. Select Rssi as the attribute to display. 

![RSSI in entity card](/pictures/RSSI_in_entity_card.png)

If you want to use the entities card (with multple sensors), just add a sensor entity from which you want to display the RSSI to the entities card and click on the pencil. First change the icon and name and click on `view code editor` at the bottom (note that there are two `view code editor` buttons, use the one at the bottom). Change the code to the following format.

```
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.ble_temperature_livingroom
    type: attribute
    attribute: rssi
    icon: 'hass:antenna'
    name: RSSI
    suffix: dB
```

A third option is more advanced and will create a new sensor based on a template sensor. If you e.g. want to use graphs, you will need to create a template sensor. Add the following to your YAML configuration and modify `livingroom` to represent your own sensor.

```
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      ble_rssi_livingroom:
        friendly_name: "RSSI BLE sensor Livingroom"
        device_class: signal_strength
        unit_of_measurement: dB
        value_template: >-
          {% set sensors = [state_attr('sensor.ble_temperature_livingroom','rssi')|float, state_attr('sensor.ble_humidity_livingroom','rssi')|float, state_attr('sensor.ble_battery_livingroom','rssi')|float] %}
          {% if sensors | sum == 0 %}
            -99 
          {% else %}
            {{ ((sensors | sum) / (sensors | select('lt',0) | list | length)) | round | int }} 
          {% endif %}
```

After a restart, a new sensor `sensor.ble_rssi_livingroom` will be created, which you can use where you want.

## DEBUG

To enable debug logging, add the following lines to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warn
  logs:
    custom_components.ble_monitor: debug
```

In addition, the `btmon` utility can provide a lot of useful information.
For example, using the command

```shell
btmon --write hcitrace.snoop | tee hcitrace.txt
```

You can write to the hcitrace.snoop and hcitrace.txt files the moment the problem occurs and attach this files to your issue.

## FORUM

You can more freely discuss the operation of the component, ask for support, leave feedback and share your experience in [our topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/passive-ble-monitor-integration-xiaomi-mijia-ble-mibeacon-monitor/) on the Home Assistant forum.
